Our cells become specialised by controlling which of those genes are “on” or “off”, and how much transcript “on” genes can produce. Each cell type therefore has a specific “transcriptomic profile” which can be observed, measured and manipulated to understand its regulation, plasticity and potential. Crucially for research into cancers (and other diseases), we can compare the profile of normal cells to cancers to understand what has gone wrong, and to identify particular processes which could be targeted therapeutically.",

This was accelerated through The Astellas European Foundation Prize in Urology awarded to Professor Jennifer Southgate and Dr Simon Baker in 2010 with the aim of deriving \"The Urotheliome\" - a high resolution transcriptomic map of urothelial differentation and plasticity. We have now developed datasets of urothelial differentiation, stimulations by particular gene regulators and drugs, characterised bladder cancer cell lines, and developed specific transcriptomic signatures of immune activation, viral infection and metabolic dysregulation. These datasets are all interrogated with reference to international bladder cancer cohorts, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and UROMOL consortia. By working with normal data we are also able to understand which genes are transcribed in urothelium, and which transcripts correspond to immune and muscle contamination of tumours.",
